🔐 Uni-Trust: Decentralized Academic Credential System
=====================================================

🚀 A **decentralized academic credential sharing system** with **selective disclosure** and **revocation support**, implemented using **Merkle Trees**, **blockchain-based revocation lists**, and **secure key exchange protocols**. Designed and developed as part of a university project for the _Algorithms and Protocols for Security_ course.

> Demonstrated ability to design and implement secure, privacy-preserving credential management systems using cryptographic protocols, blockchain-based revocation, and Merkle Tree–based selective disclosure.

* * *

📌 Overview
-----------

**Uni-Trust** is a **secure academic credential management system** enabling **students, universities, and certification authorities** to exchange credentials in a **privacy-preserving**, **verifiable**, and **revocable** manner.

This project was developed at the **University of Salerno** as a practical application of cryptographic techniques to improve **student mobility programs** such as Erasmus, reducing reliance on centralized authorities and improving **trust** and **interoperability** between institutions.

### 📁 Project Highlights

* ✅ **Selective disclosure** of academic credentials using **Merkle Trees**
    
* 🔐 **Decentralized revocation management** via **blockchain-based Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)**
    
* 🔑 **Mutual authentication** and **secure key distribution protocols** to establish session keys
    
* 🧾 **Rich credential structure** supporting personal data, courses, exams, degrees, and attendance records
    
* 📊 **Performance analysis** on credential size, cryptographic overhead, and latency
    
* 🧪 **Threat modeling** and **security analysis** covering common attack vectors
    

* * *

🌍 Language Note
----------------

All **code comments and internal documentation** are written in **Italian**, as the project was developed during a group exam at the **University of Salerno (Italy)**.

Despite this, the **codebase follows international best practices**, with clear method names and class structures that make it easily understandable for global developers and recruiters.

💡 Features
-----------

### 🧾 Credential Management

* **Issuance** of academic credentials by universities
    
* **Selective disclosure** of only necessary fields (e.g., specific course completions)
    
* **Verifiable Merkle proofs** for disclosed credentials
    

### 🔐 Security & Privacy

* **RSA asymmetric encryption** for identity validation and signing
    
* **AES symmetric encryption** for session communication
    
* **Secure key distribution protocol** using nonces and identity verification
    
* **Blockchain-based revocation** of credentials to ensure real-time trust
    

### 🧮 Advanced Capabilities

* **Merkle Tree–based credential structure** enabling partial disclosure without exposing full datasets
    
* **Revocation List (CRL)** management on a decentralized blockchain (the blockchain interaction is simulated as it was beyond the scope of the project)
    
* **Resilience to attacks** like man-in-the-middle, identity theft, and credential tampering
    

* * *

🧠 Development Process
----------------------

> Developed within a structured **university project framework** (Project Work), with clearly defined **work packages** for modeling, design, security analysis, and implementation.

1. **Requirements Analysis & Threat Modeling** (WP1)
    
2. **System Design**: Credential structure, secure exchange, revocation handling (WP2)
    
3. **Security Analysis**: Evaluation against defined adversary models (WP3)
    
4. **Implementation**: Modular Python code with cryptographic best practices (WP4)
    

* * *

🧪 Testing
----------

The system has been tested with:

* **Unit tests** for encryption/decryption, Merkle Tree verification, and proof generation
    
* **Simulated communication workflows** between students and universities
    
* **Latency and overhead analysis** for cryptographic operations
    

* * *
