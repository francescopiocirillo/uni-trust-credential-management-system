üîê Uni-Trust: Decentralized Academic Credential System
=====================================================

> üöÄ A privacy-preserving, decentralized system for managing academic credentials, built for international student mobility programs like Erasmus. Designed with a modular architecture and security-first principles as part of a university project.

* * *

üìå Overview
-----------

**Uni-Trust** is a secure and interoperable system for issuing, selectively disclosing, and revoking **academic credentials**. It was developed as part of a team project for a graduate-level security engineering course, and reflects a real-world design and development workflow with strong emphasis on **privacy**, **verifiability**, and **cross-border compatibility**.

### üìÅ Project Highlights

* ‚úÖ Verifiable credentials based on W3C standards  
* üß† Selective disclosure using cryptographic proofs  
* üîÑ Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for identity management  
* üö´ Revocable and non-transferable credential issuance  
* üìä Formal threat model and security analysis  
* üß™ Prototype with performance evaluation  
* üìå Focus on constrained devices (e.g., smartphones)

* * *

üåç Language Note
----------------

All internal documentation and diagrams are written in **Italian**, as the project was developed during a group exam at the **University of Salerno (Italy)**.

However, all code, protocol specifications, and technical elements are written following **international best practices**, and are understandable by developers worldwide.

üí° Features
-----------

### üéì Credential Lifecycle

* Credential issuance by an authorized university  
* Verifiable presentation to another institution  
* Selective attribute disclosure  
* Efficient revocation support  

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Properties

* Integrity and authenticity via digital signatures  
* Privacy via selective disclosure and unlinkability  
* Resistance to forgery, replay attacks, and identity theft  
* Local-first architecture to minimize external dependencies  

### üì∂ Interoperability

* Based on **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **DIDs**  
* Suitable for integration with existing identity ecosystems  
* No centralized trust anchor required

üß† Development Process
----------------------

> Developed over 8 weeks as a capstone project, following a milestone-based plan with parallel task assignments.

1. ‚úÖ **Modeling & Requirement Analysis**  
2. üîê **Threat Modeling & Security Objectives**  
3. üß± **Protocol Design & System Architecture**  
4. üíª **Proof-of-concept Implementation**  
5. üìä **Performance Evaluation**  
6. üìÑ **Final Documentation and Presentation**  

Each team member was responsible for two distinct work packages (WPs).

* * *

üß™ Testing & Evaluation
------------------------

Although the system is not a production-grade tool, a simulated **proof-of-concept** was built to evaluate:

* Credential size on constrained devices  
* Verification latency  
* Cryptographic overhead  
* Revocation mechanisms  

Results and benchmarks are available in the `WP4_Implementation/results/` folder.
